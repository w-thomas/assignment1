My name is Will and I'm in my second year in the CS program at OSU. I got my first degree in 2009 in English lit, but after spending the past 5 years working for software companies on the business side I decided I wanted to shift to a more technical focus.

Outside of work in school my hobbies include reading, video games, guitar and homebrewing beer.

Programming Background:
My favorite project in CS 162 was the combat game we created. It was an excersise in using class objects, and involved creating a simple text based RPG combat game similar to something like Dungeongs and Dragons.

I also liked Assembly Language and Computer Architecture. It was a very fascinating class and I enjoyed learning more about how processors and machine code work.
