My name is Will and I'm in my second year in the CS program at OSU. I got my first degree in 2009 in English lit, but after spending the past 5 years working for software companies on the business side I decided I wanted to shift to a more technical focus.

Outside of work in school my hobbies include reading, video games, guitar and homebrewing beer.
